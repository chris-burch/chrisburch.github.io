Welcome to Chris Burch's github.

This project contains the code for my Python project-Orc Invasion, based on the game Alien Invaders. 

You'll have to download the images from here (bmp files) and create a file named "images" and save it in the same folder where the code is located.

Enjoy.

Thanks!
